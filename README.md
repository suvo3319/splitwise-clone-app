Commit 1 : This is a new project I am working on which is supposed to be the splitwise app clone I am still figuring out how to work on the front-end approach and even in backend approach I am not sure how can I figure out thelogic, for now I am not using any database I am saving & reading all the data from the local json file, I am thinking of using MongoDB but only after doing some work on frontend and atleast complete the app FE,BE logicwise. I will be use react & tailwind CS.

/***********************************************************************************************************************************/

BE: I created the logic for add the group name and saving it in the JSON file as a object with the id generating using nanoid, I tried to use MVC, and make the folder structure accordingly.
