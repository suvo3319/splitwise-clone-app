Commit 1 : This is a new project I am working on which is supposed to be the splitwise app clone I am still figuring out how to work on the front-end approach and even in backend approach I am not sure how can I figure out thelogic, for now I am not using any database I am saving & reading all the data from the local json file, I am thinking of using MongoDB but only after doing some work on frontend and atleast complete the app FE,BE logicwise. I will be use react & tailwind CS.

/***********************************************************************************************************************************/

BE: I created the logic for add the group name and saving it in the JSON file as a object with the id generating using nanoid, I tried to use MVC, and make the folder structure accordingly.

Commit 2 : In this commit I added the feature to add members in a group & save it in the local storage.

/***********************************************************************************************************************************/

/***********************************************************************************************************************************/

Commit 3: In this commit I added the get routes to fetch the data, I am planning using callback to utilize also in the post request will work on that letter commit.

/***********************************************************************************************************************************/

Commit 4: In this commit I completed the backend logic for the application I tried to give each member a ID and after simplified I am not posting the data in the JSON file just getting the response as a get request I tried only simple transactions in postman complex transactions like transaction with decimal may or may not break the application. I also doont added any checker if the overall transaction is becoming 0 or not will think about that after completing the frontend and deployment the whole application to work in bbasic transaction (like version 1.0.0) also need to  work on db configuration after creating frontend before deployment that will also effect backend a lot.

Commit 5: In this commit I push all the frontend changes required & it able to call the API from frontend successfully but due to some datatype the displaying is not working properly will work on that later & will try to do the firts draft of the complete working applicatin.
